      <description>For the V4 version of this blog, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to remove all the old entries and start from scratch. With one significant change though: posting tech content only.
Over time I&amp;rsquo;ve lost interest in writing travel blogs and inflicting my unfiltered thoughts on public forums. At the same time, I&amp;rsquo;d started documenting my experiences and learnings at work, conversations with other people in industry and takeaways from reading up on the topics that excite me.</description>

      <description>I have 10+ years of experience working for 4 early stage startups (two exits), building enterprise and consumer products from ground up. During this time, I&amp;rsquo;ve led distributed teams to deliver secure, scalable and high growth products.
My primary focus has been to design iterable application architecture to deliver maximum value. I&amp;rsquo;ve built products that help organizations and teams deploy their code faster, flowing through a series of complex DevOps transitions and gateways.</description>
