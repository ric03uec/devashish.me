      <description>I have 10+ years of experience working for 4 early stage startups (two exits), building enterprise and consumer products from ground up. During this time, I&amp;rsquo;ve led distributed teams to deliver secure, scalable and high growth products.
My primary focus has been to design iterable application architecture to deliver maximum value. I&amp;rsquo;ve built products that help organizations and teams deploy their code faster, flowing through a series of complex DevOps transitions and gateways.</description>
