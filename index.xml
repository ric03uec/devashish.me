        <description>devashish.me https://devashish.me/posts/initial_commit/ -&lt;p&gt;For the V4 version of this blog, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to remove all the old entries and start
from scratch. With one significant change though: posting tech content only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time I&amp;rsquo;ve lost interest in writing travel blogs and inflicting my unfiltered
thoughts on public forums. At the same time, I&amp;rsquo;d started documenting my
experiences and learnings at work, conversations with other people in industry
and takeaways from reading up on the topics that excite me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I (re)started this blog with a few objectives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document my journey in building tech solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep notes about interesting concepts, their implementations and other aspects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have discussion(s) about the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; way to solve problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To new beginnings!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>devashish.me https://devashish.me/about/ -&lt;p&gt;I have 10+ years of experience working for 4 early stage startups (two exits),
building enterprise and consumer products from ground
up. During this time, I&amp;rsquo;ve led distributed teams to deliver secure, scalable
and high growth products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My primary focus has been to design iterable application architecture to deliver
maximum value. I&amp;rsquo;ve built products that help organizations and teams
deploy their code faster, flowing through a series of complex DevOps transitions
and gateways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the automation-first approach, I believe in creating processes to
optmize developer productivity, democratize team learning and maximize cross
team collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When not working, I like to cook, hike, play tennis, ride my motorcycle or think
of ways to automate some part of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
